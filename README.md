## Support Notes

### Windows

These executables are not signed, so in any prompts where Windows would generally show developer information, it will warn you that this app is not signed. This would cost me money, and the process is a bit convoluted.

This should not prevent its usage.

### MacOS

The dmg package is not signed or notorized, and your computer will warn you that this application is made by an untrusted developer. You will need to trust this application in order to run it. Apple keeps changing the process for doing this with every OS update for some reason, so it might be best to search how to do this for your specific OS version. Becoming a trusted developer is quite expensive for an open-source application.

### Linux (BETA)

This package may or may not work. It's still a work in progress. If you experience an issue, please [create a bug](https://github.com/glitter-xyz/glittr/issues/new) or reach out to me on [twitter @kirilv](https://twitter.com/kirilv).
